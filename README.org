* CMPE 152 Pascal Scanner
** Makefile

Running the make command like so should generate the `./scanner` executable

#+begin_src shell
make
#+end_src

This also includes a `make clean` command 

#+begin_src shell
make clean
#+end_src

That deletes `.o` files. `*~` files and testing files. 

The testing command is pretty simple

#+begin_src shell
make test
#+end_src

Runs a `diff` command on hand generated data. `test-in.txt` which is a standard pascal program that prints "Hello World" 10 times to the screen 

The `//` comment is a line comment in pascal used to verify the token labels and are not to be evaluated
