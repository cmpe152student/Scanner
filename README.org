* Makefile

** make all (make)

The make all command is for rebuilding and retesting this program

#+begin_src shell
make all
#+end_src

Includes all of the targets. Enjoy your `./scanner` executable. 

*** make

This is the default so running

#+begin_src shell
make
#+end_src

Should be the same as running `make all`


** make scanner

This builds the scanner program and generates the `./scanner` executable

#+begin_src shell
make scanner
#+end_src

** make clean

#+begin_src shell
make clean
#+end_src

That deletes `.o` files. `*~` files, and testing files.


** make test

The testing command is pretty simple

#+begin_src shell
make test
#+end_src

Runs a `diff` command on hand generated data. `test-in.txt` which is a standard pascal program that prints "Hello World" 10 times to the screen 

The `//` comment is a line comment in pascal used to verify the token labels and are not to be evaluated. These are for help when hand testing the data.
